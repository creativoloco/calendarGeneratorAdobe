# Calendar Generator for adobe illustrator and indesign
When you attempt to design a calendar whether in Illustrator or Indesign, you forced to make everything from scratch. Or maybe you consider to browse in interntet a couple of hours to find an application that allows you to download  an entire calendar in PDF.
If you success finding and downloading a trusted calendar in PDF or SVG file format, you would want to import to your designing app (wheter Illustrator or Indesign).  Sometimes could be tricky to stylize each element in an already imported PDF file format.
Then, likely you have spent too much time finding and stylizing the elements of your calendar design.
I have found that almost every calendar design have similar patterns: each day has a virtual box that allows you justify the number inside it, holidays has identical style, months could be splitted in two or one week, etc...

This plugin allows you focus in designing, avoiding spent time on the basic stuff of calendars. You can trust on that every number of day belongs to its corresponding day name, and each day have their corresponding style.
